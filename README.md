# quiz-me
Quiz to test your skills on Wisconsin trivia.

## Description
This application uses minimal HTML and mostly Javascript functionality to make a quiz to test your knowledge. The score is a combination of the time you have left and the amount of questions you get right, but watch out, time is deducted for every wrong answer. Top 3 scores are saved to the leader board.

## future development
For future development, I would like to be able to add functionality that will not allow someone to just quickly click wrong answers and still get a high score due to time saved.

I would also like to add some basic CSS styling to the page as well.
